# Crudely Typed

Simple "everyday CRUD" Postgres queries with perfect TypeScript types.

TODO:

- [ ] Publish to npm
- [ ] Settle on name
- [ ] Write docs
- [ ] Test in cityci (requires publishing new pg-to-ts with `$type`)
- [ ] Set up CI
- [ ] Split select unit/type tests
- [ ] Check types in type tests
- [ ] Write type tests for:
  - [ ] Update
  - [ ] Delete
  - [ ] Insert

For issues:

- [ ] Limit joins to join-able columns
- [ ] Support both node-postgres _and_ pg-promise
- [ ] Add upsert
